When a user types a URL and presses search, the browser asks the DNS system for the IP address of the server that hosts the URL. Once the IP is returned, the browser connects to the server using the HTTP or HTTPS protocol. Then, it sends a GET request to retrieve the necessary data to build the webpage. The web server responds with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript using the same protocol, and the browser interprets this content to render the page the user sees on the screen.
